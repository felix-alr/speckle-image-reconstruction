# Handwritten Digit Scattered Image Reconstruction
In this university project I was given a dataset of images of handwritten digits which have been scattered by a diffuser as well as their original images.
The task is to train an MLP as well as a U-Net to be able to reconstruct the images of the digits from a given scattered image.
